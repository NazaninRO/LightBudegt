# LightBudegt
LightBudget seeks design and construction techniques to balance daylight autonomy and whole-life carbon emissions, aligning with net-zero goals. My open-access Rhino-Grasshopper codes generate design alternatives for typical Swiss dwellings and enables fast and accurate analysis of daylight, energy and LCA.
